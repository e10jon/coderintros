Displays all sizes of each image, including name, dimensions, and permalink for each size.

== Description ==

= View and Use Every Size of Your Images =

When you upload an image to your WordPress site, WordPress auto-generates lots of sizes of it. However, there aren't many good ways to see and use those sizes:

* The Media Attachment page in "Media" doesn't list anything about the different image sizes, or the permalinks to use them.
* "Add Media" in the post editor doesn't always show you all the sizes that exist (such as sizes intended for featured images).
* There's no easy way to simply copy a custom-sized image's permalink.

Until now! Display All Image Sizes displays information about every size of every image: name, dimensions, and permalink.

= How to Use =

Just install and activate the plugin, and you'll see a list of all sizes of each image in both the "Add Media" pop-up modal, and in each image's individual page in "Media." (See Screenshots.)
